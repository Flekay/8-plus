insecure passwords list

## password requirements:
- at least 8 characters
- at least 1 uppercase letter
- at least 1 lowercase letter
- at least 1 number
- at least 1 special character
- no 3 or more repeated characters (e.g. aaa, AAA, 111, !!!)
- no 3 consecutive characters, even in reverse order (e.g. 123, AbC, cba)

## additonal recommendations:
- Not part of your email address (i.e. if your email address is "aaaa@bbbb.com", "aaaa" should not be part of your password)

## custom password list:
1. add your own passwords list by creating a file in the src folder.
2. run the purge.py script to remove any passwords that do not meet the requirements.
